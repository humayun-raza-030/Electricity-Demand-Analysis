# Electricity Demand Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing electricity demand data using Python. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and regression modeling to predict electricity demand.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust data preprocessing and EDA pipeline.
- Ensure data quality and extract insightful features.
- Understand the underlying structure and trends in electricity demand data.
- Build and evaluate a regression model for predictive analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of electricity demand records and weather data stored in CSV/JSON files. The data is loaded, cleaned, processed, and analyzed to identify key patterns and relationships.

## Tasks
### 1. Data Loading and Integration
- Load multiple data files using `os`, `glob`, and `pandas`.
- Validate file formats and handle encoding issues.
- Merge data into a single Pandas DataFrame, ensuring consistency in column names and data types.
- Log the number of records and features, and note any anomalies.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
#### a) Data Cleaning and Consistency
- Identify and quantify missing values.
- Determine missing data patterns (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and decide on an imputation strategy.
- Convert columns to appropriate data types (e.g., datetime conversion).
- Detect and remove duplicate rows.
- Identify and handle outliers or anomalous entries.

#### b) Feature Engineering
- Extract temporal features (hour, day, month, season) from timestamps.
- Create derived features such as `day_of_week`, `is_weekend`, or `holiday_flag`.
- Normalize/standardize numerical features if required.
- Include markdown documentation for assumptions and decisions.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Statistical Summary:** Compute mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Plot electricity demand trends over time.
- **Univariate Analysis:** Generate histograms, boxplots, and density plots for numerical features.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Compute and visualize a correlation matrix to identify multicollinearity issues.
- **Advanced Time Series Analysis:** Perform time series decomposition and stationarity tests.

### 4. Outlier Detection and Handling
- Use **IQR-based detection** and **Z-score method** to identify outliers.
- Evaluate the impact of outliers on data analysis.
- Decide whether to remove, cap, or transform outliers and justify the approach.
- Provide before-and-after visualizations.

### 5. Regression Modeling
- Select relevant features (e.g., time-based predictors, temperature).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Develop a **Linear Regression** model (or other suitable regression techniques).
- Evaluate performance using **MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score**.
- Plot actual vs. predicted values and conduct residual analysis.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for code execution and visualization
- **Hugging Face, NLTK, spaCy** (if textual analysis is involved)

## Results & Insights
- Key trends and patterns in electricity demand.
- Effect of temporal and weather-based features on demand.
- Predictive performance of regression models.
- Impact of data preprocessing on model accuracy.
